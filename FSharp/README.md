Download the SDK for windows 10: https://dev.windows.com/en-US/downloads/windows-10-sdk

Whole process takes about 15 Minutes

Following along with the wikibooks about F Sharp Programming: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/F_Sharp_Programming/Getting_Set_Up


to run hello.fs you must have the F# 

I've added this to the path: 

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\F#\4.0\Framework\v4.0`

So I can run this command: 

`fsc -o hello.exe hello.fs`


To enter the Interactive Environment: 

`fsi`

to quit out of the interactive environmnet:

`#quit;;`

Don't forget the double semi colon!


Now that we have F# setup on our machine and we're getting the interactive environment we can compile: 

`fsc -o hello.exe hello.fs`

and run

`hello.exe`

Now go learn F#!
