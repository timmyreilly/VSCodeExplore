This is some sample files to begin playing around with VS Code


What is Visual Studio Code?
---------------------------


Visual Studio Code is a source code and text editor for Windows, Linux and OS X.[1] It includes support for debugging, embedded Git Control, rich development experiences such as intelligent code completion (also known as IntelliSense), and other features. It is also customizable, which means that users can change the editor's theme, change the editor's keyboard shortcuts, change the editor's preferences, and others. 
Visual Studio Code is based on Electron, a piece of software that is based on Chromium, which is used to deploy io.js applications for the desktop. Visual Studio Code uses the Blink layout engine to render the interface


How does it work? 
-----------------

Built on the Electron Shell with HTML based editor 'Monaco' used in F12 and Azure Websites.

Between Visual Studio and Notepad. It fairs right in the middle with other Editors like Atom, Sublime and Brackets.

To be clear, this is not a stripped down version of Visual Studio. This is an entirely new editor built from the ground up to be lightweight and highly usable right out of the box. 

What makes it cool?
